\noindent The current method for artificially aging a face in missing persons cases is flawed. The ability to produce an accurate projection with a single picture of the missing person is a powerful solution to this problem. The goal is to implement an algorithm that successfully produces a realistic interpretation of the individuals aged face. \\

Stakeholders would be parties such as the government, and other law enforcement services. The generation of aged faces is useful for tasks such as searching for missing persons. The Canadian government currently employs forensic artists to manually create projections of a missing person at a specific age. Images are generated through drawing, and a significant amount of information (such as pictures of family members) is required about the missing person. The expectation would be that a single image is required as input, and a fairly accurate representation of that person aged a certain number of years would be outputted.\\

The main entities which the domain is comprised of are machine learning, big data, and the artificial aging of human faces.\\

A machine learning approach will be used to perform the process of artificial facial aging. To generate accurately aged faces, a conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Network (cGAN) must be trained on big data. The machine learning domain is greatly affected by this project, as it will be the first project publicly available that performs artificial aging. On a similar note, if this project can generate sufficiently accurate images, it will drastically improve upon current techniques. This would make it a possibility that this technique could become the industry standard for artificial aging of human faces.\\

\section{Front-end Interface}
Author: Fanping Jiang\\

\noindent The Front-end Interface module is for user to input data and recieve prediction.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Input}\label{input}
The interface takes facial image with targeted aging period as input data. Raise error if any input is improper in any manners.
\subsubsection{Output}
The interface returns aged face after the given time period as prediction. This may take time.
